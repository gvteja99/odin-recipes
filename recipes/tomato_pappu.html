    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tomato pappu is a tangy lentil dish made with healthy pigeon pea lentils (tuvar dal), plenty of tomatoes, piquant onions, fragrant herbs and spices. Also known as tomato dal this recipe is inspired from the Andhra cuisine known for its bold and spicy flavors. However, this Andhra style tomato pappu recipe is neither spicy nor hot and makes for a comforting lunch or dinner with a side of steamed rice.</p>
    <p>Dal is also called as “Pappu” in the Telugu language. Dal means lentils in Hindi language and is a staple in Indian homes. There are many variations of making dal which vary from state to state as well as from home to home.</p>
    <p>This tomato dal has the tang and the flavors of tomatoes. Here I have done the tempering first and then sautéed the onions, ginger, garlic and tomatoes. Later arhar dal (tuvar dal or pigeon pea lentils) are added and cooked until the lentils are softened. (<a href="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/tomato-dal-andhra-tomato-dal/">Source</a>)</p>
