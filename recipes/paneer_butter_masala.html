    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Paneer butter masala, also known as butter paneer is a rich & creamy curry made with paneer, spices, onions, tomatoes, cashews and butter. As the name denotes, the curry is cooked in butter which imparts it's characteristic buttery flavor to the dish.</p>

My easy recipe will help you make the best butter paneer that tastes better than anything from a restaurant. Make this once and I am sure you will never order it in a restaurant</p>
    <p>This is my go-to butter masala recipe. I published it on my blog 6 years ago & after making it countless times, I decided to update my post with more tips, substitutes & instant pot instructions which I have tried.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cashews</li>
        <li>Paneer</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Garam Masala</li>
        <li>Kashmiri Red Chilli Powder</li>
        <li>Whole Spices</li>
        <li>Kasuri Methi</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If using store bought paneer, pour 2 cups of hot water to a bowl. Add paneer cubes & rest for about 15 to 20 mins. Later drain the water and set aside. This will soften the paneer.</li>
        <li>Pour 1 tablespoon oil to a hot pan. Add 2 green cardamoms & 1 cup cubed onions. Saute them on a medium flame till they turn transparent or lightly pink in color. This takes just 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1 and half finely chopped tomatoes and 3/4th teaspoon salt. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Then cover the pan and cook till mushy</li>
        <li>Add 3/4th to 1 teaspoon red chili powder (low heat variety), 3/4th to 1 teaspoon garam masala, 1 teaspoon coriander powder (optional), 12 to 14 cashews, 3/4th teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance the flavors)</li>
        <li>Saute this onion tomato masala on a low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. It should begin to smell good and aromatic. Turn off the stove.</li>
        <li>Cool this completely and add to a blender. Pour 1 cup water. Blend this mixture to a super smooth puree.</li>
        <li>Blend to a very smooth & silky puree. If your blender is not powerful enough to make a fine puree, then strain it through a fine strainer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan on a low flame with 1½ tbsp butter. When the butter melts, add 2 green cardamoms, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 bay leaf, 3 cloves. You can skip them if you don't have.</li>
        <li>When the spices begin to sizzle, add 1½ teaspoon ginger garlic paste. Saute for 1 minute or until you begin to smell it good. The raw smell should go away. Take care to cook this on a low to medium heat. Do not burn the paste.</li>
        <li>Next pour onion tomato puree. I also added ¼ teaspoon red chili powder for deeper color. This is completely optional. Ensure the stove flame is at low otherwise the curry begins to splatter.</li>
        <li>Immediately pour ½ cup water & mix well to bring it to a gravy consistency. If it is too thick you can add little more water.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on a medium flame until the gravy turns thick & flavorful.</li>
        <li>When the paneer butter masala gravy is ready, you will see traces of fats over the gravy. This is the color you may get. Open the lid and cook until the gravy turns thicker. Taste test and add more salt if needed</li>
        <li>Make sure the gravy reaches the desired consistency then add 200 to 250 grams paneer. Take 1 teaspoon kasuri methi in your palm and crush it between both your palms. Then add it to the butter masala. Avoid adding paneer when the gravy is still runny.</li>
        <li>Stir well. On a low flame cook covered just for 1 to 3 minutes. Cooking for longer can make the paneer harder. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons cream and stir. You should get this thick creamy texture as you see in the picture below. (<a href="https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/paneer-butter-masala-restaurant-style/">Source</a>)</li>
